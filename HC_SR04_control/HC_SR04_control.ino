/**
This sketch is to fly the helicopter based on its elevation -
it reads from the hcsr04 distance sensor every 10th of a
second to get the distance. Meanwhile, it packages the data
and sends it out to the helicopter whenver it is not using the
distance sensor.

Timer1 is in use as a countdown, then interrupt.
Timer2 is in use as a pwm.


Check!
Debug version 0:
Check to see if the hcsr04 works well attached to the timer
interrupting every 100 milliseconds. No IR code.

Check!
Debug version 1:
Make sure the IR packets get sent based on the current
value in distance. IR is no longer attached to an interrupt -
just runs in the loop.

  Check!
  Debug version 1.1:
  Try sending data at a faster rate than every 180ms. Also,
  fine-tune the DELTA_THROTTLE to make sure that it provides
  a FAST, but SMOOTH change in throttle values.

  Check!
  Debug version 1.2:
  Get it to start on its own (must be zero for like 10 sends, then positive for 10ish).

------
Debug version 2:
Final version - smooth out the noisy distance values by using
a filter on the last few data points brought in by the hcsr04.

/**
ISR triggered every time the timer overflows - measures the
distance to the nearest object.

Note to future self who might wonder about the pulseIn function inside
this function:

PulseIn should work - it doesn't use any interrupts that I can
see - it seems to just read port values, then increment a
counter every time it doesn't see a change in the port. Then
it returns the duration it waited by multiplying the number of
times it looped over the wait code by the factors needed to
turn it into microseconds (factors simply determined by clock
speed). So you are fine to use it in an ISR as long as you
give it a reasonably short timeout value.
