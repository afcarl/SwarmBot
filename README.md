Code for a swarm of robot helicopters

Currently working on a single robot helicopter, working with the Syma s107g model. Have so far cracked the IR protocol and
created a crude but working potentiometer-controlled remote. Have also created a design for the first heli's prototype and written working code for hovering the helicopter in place.
